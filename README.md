# OMG DAWESOME!

Dawesome is a digital audio workstation (DAW) with the goal of advancing "open music", 
music that is shared with its "source code", promoting remixing by humans and computers.

The music is stored in a format that retains the musical context, such as key and time 
signature, allowing for the easy modification and mutation of melodies and beats.

Dawsome is an app written for the [OMG platform](https://github.com/mikehelland/openmedia.gallery). 

## Live Collaboration

Dawesome uses WebSockets and WebRTC to connect multiple users to the same session.

## Remote Controls

WebSockets are also used to connect local devices to the session as remote controls.
Dawesome is touchscreen guitar compatible.

## Programmable

Open up the JavaScript terminal in your browser, and use `daw.song` to programmatically 
manipulate the music and your work environment.

## Embedable

Dawesome has been embedded into social networking sites, video and animation editors,
game engines, and more.

Song Processor is what appears to be a simple text editor, but it actually creates music based
on the document you create. Dawesome is embedded in the app to allow the user to switch between
text based and a more traditional DAW user interface freely.
